# real-python-python-basics
Files created while going through Real Python's "Python Basics" book.

Most chapters contain a single file for each individual section.  Those inidvidual files may include both
scratch work I did while reading and the review questions.  At the minimum they contain the review questions.
Some have better documentation than others.

Chapter 11 is packed a bit differently, as the chapter is on packages.  Single files weren't going to cut it.
